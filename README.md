SemEval 2017 Challenge - Task 6
#HashTagWars (http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2017/task6/)

 - Current AI technique for humour -> binary classification (0/1 - funny/not funny)
 - Humour has a continous nature and is subjective (wit, puns, cleverness)
 - @midnight
 - DATA: tweet - #hashtag - score (0,1,2)
 - GOAL: characterize the sense of humour, predict which tweet will be funny within the hashtag (theme)
    predictive model, pairwise comparison, external knowledge

TODO:
    # clustering hashtags, sysnsets to define similiar hashtags -> classify only with them
